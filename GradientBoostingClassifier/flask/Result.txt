The new results show an improvement in all metrics:

Accuracy: The accuracy has increased from 0.7468 to 0.7597, which means the model is correctly predicting about 76% of the cases, a slight improvement.
Precision: The precision has increased from 0.6923 to 0.6735, which means the model is correctly identifying about 67% of the people who have diabetes, a slight decrease.
Recall: The recall has increased from 0.5000 to 0.6111, which means the model is now detecting about 61% of the people who have diabetes, a significant improvement.
F1 Score: The F1 score has increased from 0.5806 to 0.6408, indicating an improvement in the balance between precision and recall.
Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix shows that the model now has fewer false negatives and more true positives, which means it is correctly identifying more people who have diabetes.
In summary, the Gradient Boosting Classifier seems to be performing better than the previous models in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1 score, but slightly worse in terms of precision. This means that while it is making slightly more false positive errors (i.e., wrongly predicting that a person has diabetes), it is making fewer false negative errors (i.e., failing to identify a person who has diabetes). Depending on the specific application, this could be a good thing. For example, in a medical context, false negatives (missing a person who has diabetes) could be more harmful than false positives (wrongly diagnosing a person with diabetes). Therefore, you might want to optimize your model to improve recall, even if it comes at the cost of precision. This is a decision that should be based on the specific costs associated with false positives and false negatives in your application. Overall, itâ€™s a good improvement!
