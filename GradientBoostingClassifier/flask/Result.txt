Improvement compared to SVC:

Accuracy: The accuracy has increased from 0.7468 to 0.7597, which means the model is correctly predicting about 76% of the cases, a slight improvement.
Precision: The precision has increased from 0.6923 to 0.6735, which means the model is correctly identifying about 67% of the people who have diabetes, a slight decrease.
Recall: The recall has increased from 0.5000 to 0.6111, which means the model is now detecting about 61% of the people who have diabetes, a significant improvement.
F1 Score: The F1 score has increased from 0.5806 to 0.6408, indicating an improvement in the balance between precision and recall.
Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix shows that the model now has fewer false negatives and more true positives, which means it is correctly identifying more people who have diabetes.
